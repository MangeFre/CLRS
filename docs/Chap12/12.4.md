> Consider $\text{RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT}$ operating on a sequence of $n$ distinct input numbers. Prove that for any constant $k > 0$, all but $O(1 / n^k)$ of the $n!$ input permutations yield an $O(n\lg n)$ running time.

Let $A(n)$ denote the probability that when quicksorting a list of length $n$, some pivot is selected to not be in the middle $n^{1 - k / 2}$ of the numberes. This doesn't happen with probability $\frac{1}{n^{k / 2}}$. Then, we have that the two subproblems are of size $n_1, n_2$ with $n_1 + n_2 = n - 1$, then

$$A(n) \le \frac{1}{n^{k / 2}} + T(n_1)+T(n_2).$$

Since we bounded the depth by $O(1 / \lg n)$ let $\\{a_{i, j}\\}_i$ be all the subproblem sizes left at depth $j$,

$$A(n) \le \frac{1}{n^{k / 2}} \sum_j\sum_i \frac{1}{a}.$$
