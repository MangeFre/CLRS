> A $d$-dimensional box with dimensions $(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_d)$ **_nests_** within another box with dimensions $(y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_d)$ if there exists a permutation $\pi$ on $\\{1, 2, \ldots, d\\}$ such that $x_{\pi(1)} < y_1$, $x_{\pi(2)} < y_2$, $\ldots$, $x_{\pi(d)} < y_d$.
>
> **a.** Argue that the nesting relation is transitive.
>
> **b.** Describe an efficient method to determine whether or not one $d$-dimensional box nests inside another.
>
> **c.** Suppose that you are given a set of $n$ $d$-dimensional boxes $\\{B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_n\\}$. Give an efficient algorithm to find the longest sequence $\langle B_{i_1}, B_{i_2}, \ldots, B_{i_k} \rangle$ of boxes such that $B_{i_j}$ nests within $B_{i_{j + 1}}$ for $j = 1, 2, \ldots, k - 1$. Express the running time of your algorithm in terms of $n$ and $d$.
