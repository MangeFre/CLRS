> A sequence is **_bitonic_** if it monotonically increases and then monotonically decreases, or if by a circular shift it monotonically increases and then monotonically decreases. For example the sequences $\langle 1, 4, 6, 8, 3, -2 \rangle$, $\langle 9, 2, -4, -10, -5 \rangle$, and $\langle 1, 2, 3, 4 \rangle$ are bitonic, but $\langle 1, 3, 12, 4, 2, 10 \rangle$ is not bitonic. (See Problem 15-3 for the bitonic euclidean traveling-salesman problem.)

> Suppose that we are given a directed graph $G = (V, E)$ with weight function $w: E \to \mathbb R$, where all edge weights are unique, and we wish to find single-source shortest paths from a source vertex $s$. We are given one additional piece of information: for each vertex $v \in V$, the weights of the edges along any shortest path from $s$ to $v$ form a bitonic sequence.
