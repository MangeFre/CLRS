> **_Arbitrage_** is the use of discrepancies in currency exchange rates to transform one unit of a currency into more than one unit of the same currency. For example, suppose that $1$ U.S. dollar buys $49$ Indian rupees, $1$ Indian rupee buys $2$ Japanese yen, and $1$ Japanese yen buys $0.0107$ U.S. dollars. Then, by converting currencies, a trader can start with $1$ U.S. dollar and buy $49 \times 2 \times 0.0107 = 1.0486$ U.S. dollars, thus turning a profit of $4.86$ percent.
