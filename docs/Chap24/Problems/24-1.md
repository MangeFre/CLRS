> Suppose that we order the edge relaxations in each pass of the Bellman-Ford algorithm as follows. Before the first pass, we assign an arbitrary linear order $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_{|V|}$ to the vertices of the input graph $G = (V, E)$. Then, we partition the edge set $E$ into $E_f \cup E_b$, where $E_f = \\{(v_i, v_j) \in E: i < j\\}$ and $E_b = \\{(v_i, v_j) \in E: i > j\\}$. (Assume that $G$ contains no self-loops, so that every edge is in either $E_f$ or $E_b$.) Define $G_f = (V, E_f)$ and $G_b = (V, E_b)$.

> Suppose that we implement each pass of the Bellman-Ford algorithm in the following way. We visit each vertex in the order $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_{|V|}$, relaxing edges of $E_f$ that leave the vertex. We then visit each vertex in the order $v_{|V|}, v_{|V| - 1}, \ldots, v_1$, relaxing edges of $E_b$ that leave the vertex.

> **b.** Prove that with this scheme, if $G$ contains no negative-weight cycles that are reachable from the source vertex $s$, then after only $\lceil |V| / 2 \rceil$ passes over the edges, $v.d = \delta(s, v)$ for all vertices $v \in V$.
