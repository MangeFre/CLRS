> A **_palindrome_** is a nonempty string over some alphabet that reads the same forward and backward. Examples of palindromes are all strings of length $1$, $\text{civic}$, $\text{racecar}$, and $\text{aibohphobia}$ (fear of palindromes).

> Give an efficient algorithm to find the longest palindrome that is a subsequence of a given input string. For example, given the input $\text{character}$, your algorithm should return $\text{carac}$. What is the running time of your algorithm?
