> Consider the problem of making change for $n$ cents using the fewest number of coins. Assume that each coin's value is an integer.
>
> **a.** Describe a greedy algorithm to make change consisting of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies. Prove that your algorithm yields an optimal solution.
>
> **b.** Suppose that the available coins are in the denominations that are powers of $c$, i.e., the denominations are $c^0, c^1, \ldots, c^k$ for some integers $c > 1$ and $k \ge 1$. Show that the greedy algorithm always yields an optimal solution.
>
> **c.** Give a set of coin denominations for which the greedy algorithm does not yield an optimal solution. Your set should include a penny so that there is a solution for every value of $n$.
>
> **d.** Give an $O(nk)$-time algorithm that makes change for any set of $k$ different coin denominations, assuming that one of the coins is a penny.
