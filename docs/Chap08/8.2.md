## 8.2-1

> Using Figure 8.2 as a model, illustrate the operation of $\text{COUNTING-SORT}$ on the array $A = \langle 6, 0, 2, 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 1, 3, 2 \rangle$.

We have that $C = \langle 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 9, 11 \rangle$. Then, after successive iterations of the loop on lines 10-12, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
B & = \langle, , , , , 2, , , , , \rangle, \\\\
B & = \langle, , , , , 2, , 3, , , \rangle, \\\\
B & = \langle, , , 1, , 2, , 3, , , \rangle
\end{aligned}
$$

and at the end,

$$B = \langle 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 6, 6 \rangle.$$

## 8.2-4

> Describe an algorithm that, given n integers in the range $0$ to $k$, preprocesses its input and then answers any query about how many of the $n$ integers fall into a range $[a..b]$ in $O(1)$ time. Your algorithm should use $\Theta(n + k)$ preprocessing time.
