> In this problem, we prove a probabilistic $\Omega(n\lg n)$ lower bound on the running time of any deterministic or randomized comparison sort on $n$ distinct input elements. We begin by examining a deterministic comparison sort $A$ with decision tree $T_A$. We assume that every permutation of $A$'s inputs is equally likely.
>
> **a.** Suppose that each leaf of $T_A$ is labeled with the probability that it is reached given a random input. Prove that exactly $n!$ leaves are labeled $1 / n!$ and that the rest are labeled $0$.
>
> **b.** Let $D(T)$ denote the external path length of a decision tree $T$; that is, $D(T)$ is the sum of the depths of all the leaves of $T$. Let $T$ be a decision tree with $k > 1$ leaves, and let $LT$ and $RT$ be the left and right subtrees of $T$. Show that $D(T) = D(LT) + D(RT)+k$.
>
> **c.** Let $d(k)$ be the minimum value of $D(T)$ over all decision trees $T$ with $k > 1$ leaves. Show that $d(k) = \min _{1 \le i \le k - 1} \\{ d(i) + d(k - i) + k \\}$. ($\textit{Hint:}$ Consider a decision tree $T$ with $k$ leaves that achieves the minimum. Let $i_0$ be the number of leaves in $LT$ and $k - i_0$ the number of leaves in $RT$.)
>
> **d.** Prove that for a given value of $k > 1$ and $i$ in the range $1 \le i \le k - 1$, the function $i\lg i + (k - i) \lg(k - i)$ is minimized at $i = k / 2$. Conclude that $d(k) = \Omega(k\lg k)$.
>
> **e.** Prove that $D(T_A) = \Omega(n!\lg(n!))$, and conclude that the average-case time to sort $n$ elements is $\Omega(n\lg n)$.
>
> Now, consider a _randomized_ comparison sort $B$. We can extend the decision-tree model to handle randomization by incorporating two kinds of nodes: ordinary comparison nodes and "randomization" nodes. A randomization node models a random choice of the form $\text{RANDOM}(1, r)$ made by algorithm $B$; the node has $r$ children, each of which is equally likely to be chosen during an execution of the algorithm.
>
> **f.** Show that for any randomized comparison sort $B$, there exists a deterministic comparison sort $A$ whose expected number of comparisons is no more than those made by $B$.
