> Rewrite the $\text{MERGE}$ procedure so that it does not use sentinels, instead stopping once either array $L$ or $R$ has had all its elements copied back to $A$ and then copying the remainder of the other array back into $A$.

```cpp
MERGE(A, p, q, r)
    n[1] = q - p + 1
    n[2] = r - q
    let L[1..n[1]] and R[1..n[2]] be new arrays
    for i = 1 to n[1]
        L[i] = A[p + i - 1]
    for j = 1 to n[2]
        R[j] = A[q + j]
    i = 1
    j = 1
    for k = p to r
        if i > n[1]
            A[k] = R[j]
            j = j + 1
        else if j > n[2]
            A[k] = L[i]
            i = i + 1
        else if L[i] ≤ R[j]
            A[k] = L[i]
            i = i + 1
        else
            A[k] = R[j]

> We can express insertion sort as a recursive procedure as follows. In order to sort $A[1..n]$, we recursively sort $A[1..n - 1]$ and then insert $A[n]$ into the sorted array $A[1..n - 1]$. Write a recurrence for the running time of this recursive version of insertion sort.

## 2.3-5

> Referring back to the searching problem (see Exercise 2.1-3), observe that if the sequence $A$ is sorted, we can check the midpoint of the sequence against $v$ and eliminate half of the sequence from further consideration. The **_binary search_** algorithm repeats this procedure, halving the size of the remaining portion of the sequence each time. Write pseudocode, either iterative or recursive, for binary search. Argue that the worst-case running time of binary search is $\Theta(\lg n)$.

## 2.3-6

> Observe that the **while** loop of lines 5–7 of the $\text{INSERTION-SORT}$ procedure in Section 2.1 uses a linear search to scan (backward) through the sorted subarray $A[i..j - 1]$. Can we use a binary search (see Exercise 2.3-5) instead to improve the overall worst-case running time of insertion sort to $\Theta(n\lg n)$?
