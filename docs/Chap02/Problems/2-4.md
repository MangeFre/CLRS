> Let $A[1..n]$ be an array of $n$ distinct numbers. If $i < j$ and $A[i] > A[j]$, then the pair $(i, j)$ is called an **_inversion_** of $A$.
>
> **a.** List the five inversions in the array $\langle 2, 3, 8, 6, 1 \rangle$.
>
> **b.** What array with elements from the set $\\{1, 2, \ldots, n\\}$ has the most inversions? How many does it have?
>
> **c.** What is the relationship between the running time of insertion sort and the number of inversions in the input array? Justify your answer.
>
> **d.** Give an algorithm that determines the number of inversions in any permutation of $n$ elements in $\Theta(n\lg n)$ worst-case time. ($\textit{Hint:}$ Modify merge sort).
