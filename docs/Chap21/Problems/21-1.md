> The **_off-line minimum problem_** asks us to maintain a dynamic set $T$ of elements from the domain $\\{1, 2, \ldots, n\\}$ under the operations $\text{INSERT}$ and $\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$. We are given a sequence $S$ of $n$ $\text{INSERT}$ and $m$ $\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$ calls, where each key in $\\{1, 2, \ldots, n\\}$ is inserted exactly once. We wish to determine which key is returned by each $\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$ call. Specifically, we wish to fill in an array $extracted[1..m]$, where for $i = 1, 2, \ldots, m$, $extracted[i]$ is the key returned by the $i$th $\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$ call. The problem is "off-line" in the sense that we are allowed to process the entire sequence $S$ before determining any of the returned keys.

For each subsequence $\text{I}_j$ , we initially place the keys inserted by these operations into a set $K_j$, which is empty if $\text{I}_j$ is empty. We then do the following:
