> **a.** Suppose that we use a tree representation similar to a disjoint-set forest: $v.p$ is the parent of node $v$, except that $v.p = v$ if $v$ is a root. Suppose further that we implement $\text{GRAFT}(r, v)$ by setting $r.p = v$ and $\text{FIND-DEPTH}(v)$ by following the find path up to the root, returning a count of all nodes other than $v$ encountered. Show that the worst-case running time of a sequence of $m$ $\text{MAKE-TREE}$, $\text{FIND-DEPTH}$, and $\text{GRAFT}$ operations is $\Theta(m^2)$.
>
> By using the union-by-rank and path-compression heuristics, we can reduce the worst-case running time. We use the disjoint-set forest $\mathcal S = \\{S_i\\}$, where each set $S_i$ (which is itself a tree) corresponds to a tree $T_i$ in the forest $\mathcal F$. The tree structure within a set $S_i$, however, does not necessarily correspond to that of $T_i$. In fact, the implementation of $S_i$ does not record the exact parent-child relationships but nevertheless allows us to determine any node's depth in $T_i$.
>
> The key idea is to maintain in each node $v$ a "pseudodistance" $v.d$, which is defined so that the sum of the pseudodistances along the simple path from $v$ to the root of its set $S_i$ equals the depth of $v$ in $T_i$. That is, if the simple path from $v$ to its root in $S_i$ is $v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_k$, where $v_0 = v$ and $v_k$ is $S_i$'s root, then the depth of $v$ in $T_i$ is $\sum_{j = 0}^k v_j.d$.

> **c.** Show how to modify $\text{FIND-SET}$ to implement $\text{FIND-DEPTH}$. Your implementation should perform path compression, and its running time should be linear in the length of the find path. Make sure that your implementation updates pseudodistances correctly.
>
> **d.** Show how to implement $\text{GRAFT}(r, v)$, which combines the sets containing $r$ and $v$, by modifying the $\text{UNION}$ and $\text{LINK}$ procedures. Make sure that your implementation updates pseudodistances correctly. Note that the root of a set $S_i$ is not necessarily the root of the corresponding tree $T_i$.
