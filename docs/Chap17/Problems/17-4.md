> There are four basic operations on red-black trees that perform **_structural modifications_**: node insertions, node deletions, rotations, and color changes. We have seen that $\text{RB-INSERT}$ and $\text{RB-DELETE}$ use only $O(1)$ rotations, node insertions, and node deletions to maintain the red-black properties, but they may make many more color changes.
>
> **a.** Describe a legal red-black tree with $n$ nodes such that calling $\text{RB-INSERT}$ to add the $(n + 1)$st node causes $\Omega(\lg n)$ color changes. Then describe a legal red-black tree with $n$ nodes for which calling $\text{RB-DELETE}$ on a particular node causes $\Omega(\lg n)$ color changes.
>
> Although the worst-case number of color changes per operation can be logarithmic, we shall prove that any sequence of $m$ $\text{RB-INSERT}$ and $\text{RB-DELETE}$ operations on an initially empty red-black tree causes $O(m)$ structural modifications in the worst case. Note that we count each color change as a structural modification.
>
> **b.** Some of the cases handled by the main loop of the code of both $\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$ and $\text{RB-DELETE-FIXUP}$ are **_terminating_**: once encountered, they cause the loop to terminate after a constant number of additional operations. For each of the cases of $\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$ and $\text{RB-DELETE-FIXUP}$, specify which are terminating and which are not. ($\textit{Hint:}$ Look at Figures 13.5, 13.6, and 13.7.)
>
> We shall first analyze the structural modifications when only insertions are performed. Let $T$ be a red-black tree, and define $\Phi(T)$ to be the number of red nodes in $T$. Assume that $1$ unit of potential can pay for the structural modifications performed by any of the three cases of $\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$.
>
> **c.** Let $T'$ be the result of applying Case 1 of $\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$ to $T$. Argue that $\Phi(T') = \Phi(T) - 1$.
>
> **d.** When we insert a node into a red-black tree using $\text{RB-INSERT}$, we can break the operation into three parts. List the structural modifications and potential changes resulting from lines 1â€“16 of $\text{RB-INSERT}$, from nonterminating cases of $\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$, and from terminating cases of $\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$.
>
> **e.** Using part (d), argue that the amortized number of structural modifications performed by any call of $\text{RB-INSERT}$ is $O(1)$.
>
> We now wish to prove that there are $O(m)$ structural modifications when there are both insertions and deletions. Let us define, for each node $x$,

> w(x) =
> \begin{cases}
>     0 & \text{ if } x \text{ is red}, \\\\
>     1 & \text{ if } x \text{ is black and has no red children}, \\\\
>     0 & \text{ if } x \text{ is black and has one red children}, \\\\
>     2 & \text{ if } x \text{ is black and has two red children}.

> **f.** Show that $\Phi(T') \le \Phi(T) - 1$ for all nonterminating cases of $\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$. Argue that the amortized number of structural modifications performed by any call of $\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$ is $O(1)$.
