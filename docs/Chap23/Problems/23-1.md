> Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected, connected graph whose weight function is $w: E \rightarrow \mathbb R$, and suppose that $|E| \ge |V|$ and all edge weights are distinct.

> We define a second-best minimum spanning tree as follows. Let $\mathcal T$ be the set of all spanning trees of $G$, and let $T'$ be a minimum spanning tree of $G$. Then a **_second-best minimum spanning tree_** is a spanning tree $T$ such that $W(T) = \min_{T'' \in \mathcal T - \\{T'\\}} \\{w(T'')\\}$.

>
> **b.** Let $T$ be the minimum spanning tree of $G$. Prove that $G$ contains edges $(u, v) \in T$ and $(x, y) \notin T$ such that $T - \\{(u, v)\\} \cup \\{(x, y)\\}$ is a second-best minimum spanning tree of $G$.

> **c.** Let $T$ be a spanning tree of $G$ and, for any two vertices $u, v \in V$, let $max[u, v]$ denote an edge of maximum weight on the unique simple path between $u$ and $v$ in $T$. Describe an $O(V^2)$-time algorithm that, given $T$, computes $max[u, v]$ for all $u, v \in V$.
