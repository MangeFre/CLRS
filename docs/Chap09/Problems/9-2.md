> The **_post-office location problem_** is defined as follows. We are given $n$ points $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ with associated weights $w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n$. We wish to find a point $p$ (not necessarily one of the input points) that minimizes the sum $\sum_{i = 1}^n w_i d(p, p_i)$, where $d(a, b)$ is the distance between points $a$ and $b$.
>
> **d.** Argue that the weighted median is a best solution for the $1$-dimensional postoffice location problem, in which points are simply real numbers and the distance between points $a$ and $b$ is $d(a, b) = |a - b|$.
>
> **e.** Find the best solution for the $2$-dimensional post-office location problem, in which the points are $(x,y)$ coordinate pairs and the distance between points $a = (x_1, y_1)$ and $b = (x_2, y_2)$ is the **_Manhattan distance_** given by $d(a, b) = |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|$.
