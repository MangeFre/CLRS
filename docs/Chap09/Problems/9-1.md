> Given a set of $n$ numbers, we wish to find the $i$ largest in sorted order using a comparison-based algorithm. Find the algorithm that implements each of the following methods with the best asymptotic worst-case running time, and analyze the running times of the algorithms in terms of $n$ and $i$ .
>
> **a.** Sort the numbers, and list the $i$ largest.
>
> **b.** Build a max-priority queue from the numbers, and call $\text{EXTRACT-MAX}$ $i$ times.
>
> **c.** Use an order-statistic algorithm to find the $i$th largest number, partition around that number, and sort the $i$ largest numbers.
