## 9.1-2 $\star$

> Prove the lower bound of $\lceil 3n / 2 \rceil - 2$ comparisons in the worst case to find both the maximum and minimum of $n$ numbers. ($\textit{Hint:}$ Consider how many numbers are potentially either the maximum or minimum, and investigate how a comparison affects these counts.)

If $n$ is odd, there are

$$
\begin{aligned}
1 + \frac{3(n-3)}{2} + 2
    & = \frac{3n}{2} - \frac{3}{2} \\\\
    & = (\bigg\lceil \frac{3n}{2} \bigg\rceil - \frac{1}{2}) - \frac{3}{2} \\\\
    & = \bigg\lceil \frac{3n}{2} \bigg\rceil - 2
\end{aligned}
$$

comparisons.

If $n$ is even, there are

$$
\begin{aligned}
1 + \frac{3(n - 2)}{2}
    & = \frac{3n}{2} - 2 \\\\
    & = \bigg\lceil \frac{3n}{2} \bigg\rceil - 2
\end{aligned}
$$

comparisons.
