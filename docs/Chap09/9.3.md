> Suppose that an algorithm uses only comparisons to find the $i$th smallest element in a set of $n$ elements. Show that it can also find the $i - 1$ smaller elements and $n - i$ larger elements without performing additional comparisons.

Create a graph with $n$ vertices and draw a directed edge from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$ if the $i$th and $j$th elements of the array are compared in the algorithm and we discover that $A[i] \ge A[j]$. Observe that $A[i]$ is one of the $i - 1$ smaller elements if there exists a path from $x$ to $i$ in the graph, and $A[i]$ is one of the $n - i$ larger elements if there exists a path from $i$ to $x$ in the graph. Every vertex $i$ must either lie on a path to or from $x$ because otherwise the algorithm can't distinguish between $i \le x$ and $i \ge x$. Moreover, if a vertex $i$ lies on both a path to $x$ and a path from $x$, then it must be such that $x \le A[i] \le x$,so $x = A[i]$. In this case, we can break ties arbitrarily.

> The $k$th **_quantiles_** of an $n$-element set are the $k - 1$ order statistics that divide the sorted set into $k$ equal-sized sets (to within $1$). Give an $O(n\lg k)$-time algorithm to list the $k$th quantiles of a set.

Pre-calculate the positions of the quantiles in $O(k)$, we use the $O(n)$ select algorithm to find the $\lfloor k / 2 \rfloor$th position, after that the elements are divided into two sets by the pivot the $\lfloor k / 2 \rfloor$th position, we do it recursively in the two sets to find other positions. Since the maximum depth is $\lceil \lg k \rceil$, the total running time is $O(n\lg k)$.

> Describe an $O(n)$-time algorithm that, given a set $S$ of $n$ distinct numbers and a positive integer $k \le n$, determines the $k$ numbers in $S$ that are closest to the median of $S$.

Find the median in $O(n)$; create a new array, each element is the absolute value of the original value subtract the median; find the $k$th smallest number in $O(n)$, then the desired values are the elements whose absolute difference with the median is less than or equal to the $k$th smallest number in the new array.

> Professor Olay is consulting for an oil company, which is planning a large pipeline running east to west through an oil field of $n$ wells. The company wants to connect a spur pipeline from each well directly to the main pipeline along a shortest route (either north or south), as shown in Figure 9.2. Given the $x$- and $y$-coordinates of the wells, how should the professor pick the optimal location of the main pipeline, which would be the one that minimizes the total length of the spurs? Show how to determine the optimal location in linear time.
