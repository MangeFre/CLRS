> Professor Gore wants to open up an algorithmic consulting company. He has identified n important subareas of algorithms (roughly corresponding to different portions of this textbook), which he represents by the set $A = \\{A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n\\}$. In each subarea $A_k$, he can hire an expert in that area for $c_k$ dollars. The consulting company has lined up a set $J = \\{J_1, J_2, \ldots, J_m\\}$ of potential jobs. In order to perform job $J_i$, the company needs to have hired experts in a subset $R_i \subseteq A$ of subareas. Each expert can work on multiple jobs simultaneously. If the company chooses to accept job $J_i$, it must have hired experts in all subareas in $R_i$, and it will take in revenue of $p_i$ dollars.

> Professor Gore's job is to determine which subareas to hire experts in and which jobs to accept in order to maximize the net revenue, which is the total income from jobs accepted minus the total cost of employing the experts.

> Consider the following flow network $G$. It contains a source vertex $s$, vertices $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n$, vertices $J_1, J_2, \ldots, J_m$, and a sink vertex $t$. For $k = 1, 2, \ldots, n$, the flow network contains an edge $(s, A_k)$ with capacity $c(s, A_k) = c_k$, and for $i = 1, 2, \ldots, m$, the flow network contains an edge $(J_i, t)$ with capacity $c(J_i, t) = p_i$. For $k = 1, 2, \ldots, n$ and $i = 1, 2, \ldots, m$, if $A_k \in R_i$, then $G$ contains an edge $(A_k, J_i)$ with capacity $c(A_k, J_i) = \infty$.

> **a.** Show that if $J_i \in T$ for a finite-capacity cut $(S, T)$ of $G$, then $A_k \in T$ for each $A_k \in R_i$.
>
> **b.** Show how to determine the maximum net revenue from the capacity of a minimum cut of $G$ and the given $p_i$ values.

> **c.** Give an efficient algorithm to determine which jobs to accept and which experts to hire. Analyze the running time of your algorithm in terms of $m$, $n$, and $r = \sum_{i = 1}^m |R_i|$.
