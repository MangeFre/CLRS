> A **_path cover_** of a directed graph $G = (V, E)$ is a set $P$ of vertex-disjoint paths such that every vertex in $V$ is included in exactly one path in $P$. Paths may start and end anywhere, and they may be of any length, including $0$. A **_minimum path cover_** of $G$ is a path cover containing the fewest possible paths.
