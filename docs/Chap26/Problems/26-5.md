> Let $G = (V, E)$ be a flow network with source $s$, sink $t$, and an integer capacity $c(u, v)$ on each edge $(u, v) \in E$. Let $C = \max_{(u, v) \in E} c(u, v)$.

> **a.** Argue that a minimum cut of $G$ has capacity at most $C|E|$.

> **b.** For a given number $K$, show how to find an augmenting path of capacity at least $K$ in $O(E)$ time, if such a path exists.

> MAX-FLOW-BY-SCALING(G, s, t)
>     C = max_{(u, v) ∈ E} c(u, v)
>     initialize flow f to 0
>     K = 2^{floor(lg C)}
>     while K ≥ 1
>         while there exists an augmenting path p of capacity at least K augment flow f along p
>         K = K / 2
>     return f

> **c.** Argue that $\text{MAX-FLOW-BY-SCALING}$ returns a maximum flow.
>
> **d.** Show that the capacity of a minimum cut of the residual network $G_f$ is at most $2K|E|$ each time line 4 is executed.
>
> **e.** Argue that the inner **while** loop of lines 5–6 executes $O(E)$ times for each value of $K$.
>
> **f.** Conclude that $\text{MAX-FLOW-BY-SCALING}$ can be implemented so that it runs in $O(E^2\lg C)$ time.
