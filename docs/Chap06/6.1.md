In any of the leaves, that is, elements with index $\lfloor n / 2 \rfloor + 1$ (see exercise 6.1-7), that is, in the second half of the heap array.

## 6.1-5

> Is an array that is in sorted order a min-heap?

Yes. For any index $i$, both $\text{LEFT}(i)$ and $\text{RIGHT}(i)$ are larger and thus the elements indexed by them are greater or equal to $A[i]$ (because the array is sorted.)

## 6.1-6

> Is the array with values $\langle 23, 17, 14, 6, 13, 10, 1, 5, 7, 12 \rangle$ a max-heap?

No. The property is violated by the next-to-last leaf (illustrated below in red.)

## 6.1-7

> Show that, with the array representation for sorting an $n$-element heap, the leaves are the nodes indexed by $\lfloor n / 2 \rfloor + 1, \lfloor n / 2 \rfloor + 2, \ldots, n$.

Let's take the left child of the node indexed by $\lfloor n / 2 \rfloor + 1$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{LEFT}(\lfloor n / 2 \rfloor + 1)
    & = 2(\lfloor n / 2 \rfloor + 1) \\\\
    & > 2(n / 2 - 1) + 2 \\\\
    & = n - 2 + 2 \\\\
    & = n.
\end{aligned}
$$

Since the index of the left child is larger than the number of elements in the heap, the node doesn't have childrens and thus is a leaf. Same goes for all nodes with larger indices.

Note that if we take element indexed by $\lfloor n / 2 \rfloor$, it will not be a leaf. In case of even number of nodes, it will have a left child with index $n$ and in the case of odd number of nodes, it will have a left child with index $n - 1$ and a right child with index $n$.

This makes the number of leaves in a heap of size $n$ equal to $\lceil n / 2 \rceil$.
