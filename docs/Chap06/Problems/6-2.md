> A **_$d$-ary heap_** is like a binary heap, but (with one possible exception) non-leaf nodes have $d$ children instead of $2$ children.
>
> **a.** How would you represent a $d$-ary heap in an array?
>
> **b.** What is the height of a $d$-ary heap of $n$ elements in terms of $n$ and $d$?
>
> **c.** Give an efficient implementation of $\text{EXTRACT-MAX}$ in a $d$-ary max-heap. Analyze its running time in terms of $d$ and $n$.
>
> **d.** Give an efficient implementation of $\text{INSERT}$ in a $d$-ary max-heap. Analyze its running time in terms of $d$ and $n$.
>
> **e.** Give an efficient implementation of $\text{INCREASE-KEY}(A, i, k)$, which flags an error if $k < A[i]$, but otherwise sets $A[i] = k$ and then updates the $d$-ary max-heap structure appropriately. Analyze its running time in terms of $d$ and $n$.
