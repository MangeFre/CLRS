> An **_Euler tour_** of a strongly connected, directed graph $G = (V, E)$ is a cycle that traverses each edge of $G$ exactly once, although it may visit a vertex more than once.
>
> **a.** Show that $G$ has an Euler tour if and only if $\text{in-degree}(v) = \text{out-degree}(v)$ for each vertex $v \in V$.
>
> **b.** Describe an $O(E)$-time algorithm to find an Euler tour of $G$ if one exists. ($\textit{Hint:}$ Merge edge-disjoint cycles.)
