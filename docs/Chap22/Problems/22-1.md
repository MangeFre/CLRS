> A depth-first forest classifies the edges of a graph into tree, back, forward, and cross edges. A breadth-first tree can also be used to classify the edges reachable from the source of the search into the same four categories.
>
> **a.** Prove that in a breadth-first search of an undirected graph, the following properties hold:
>
> 1. There are no back edges and no forward edges.
> 2. For each tree edge $(u, v)$, we have $v.d = u.d + 1$.
> 3. For each cross edge $(u, v)$, we have $v.d = u.d$ or $v.d = u.d + 1$.
>
> **b.** Prove that in a breadth-first search of a directed graph, the following properties hold:
>
> 1. There are no forward edges.
> 2. For each tree edge $(u, v)$, we have $v.d = u.d + 1$.
> 3. For each cross edge $(u, v)$, we have $v.d \le u.d + 1$.
> 4. For each back edge $(u, v)$, we have $0 \le v.d \le u.d$.
