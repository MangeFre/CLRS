> Show that the assumption that we are always able to determine which candidate is best in line 4 of procedure $\text{HIRE-ASSISTANT}$ implies that we know a total order on the ranks of the candidates.

A total order is a partial order that is a total relation $(\forall a, b \in A:aRb \text{ or } bRa)$.
A relation is a partial order if it is reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive.

Assume that the relation is good or better.

- **Reflexive:** This is a bit trivial, but everybody is as good or better as themselves.
- **Transitive:** If $A$ is better than $B$ and $B$ is better than $C$, then $A$ is better than $C$.
- **Antisymmetric:** If $A$ is better than $B$, then $B$ is not better than $A$.

So far we have a partial order.

Since we assume we can compare any two candidates, then comparison must be a total relation and thus we have a total order.

> Describe an implementation of the procedure $\text{RANDOM}(a, b)$ that only makes calls to $\text{RANDOM}(0, 1)$. What is the expected running time of your procedure, as a function of $a$ and $b$?

```cpp
RANDOM(a, b)
    if a == b
        return a
    mid = (a + b) / 2
    r = RANDOM(0, 1)
    if r == 0
        return RANDOM(a, floor(mid))
    else return RANDOM(ceil(mid), b)
```

The expected running time is $\Theta(\lg(b - a))$.

> Suppose that you want to output $0$ with probability $1 / 2$ and $1$ with probability $1 / 2$. At your disposal is a procedure $\text{BIASED-RANDOM}$, that outputs either $0$ or $1$. It outputs $1$ with some probability $p$ and $0$ with probability $1 - p$, where $0 < p < 1$, but you do not know what $p$ is. Give an algorithm that uses $\text{BIASED-RANDOM}$ as a subroutine, and returns an unbiased answer, returning $0$ with probability $1 / 2$ and $1$ with probability $1 / 2$. What is the expected running time of your algorithm as a function of $p$?
