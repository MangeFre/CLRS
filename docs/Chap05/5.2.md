> Use indicator random variables to compute the expected value of the sum of $n$ dice.

Expectation of a single dice $X_i$ is

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text E[X_k] & = \sum_{i = 1}^6 i \Pr\\{X_k = i\\} \\\\
             & = \frac{1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6}{6} \\\\
             & = \frac{21}{6} \\\\
             & = 3.5.
\end{aligned}
$$

As for multiple dices,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text E[X] & = \text E\Bigg[\sum_{i = 1}^n X_i \Bigg] \\\\
           & = \sum_{i = 1}^n \text E[X_i] \\\\
           & = \sum_{i = 1}^n 3.5 \\\\
           & = 3.5 \cdot n.
\end{aligned}
$$

> Use indicator random variables to solve the following problem, which is known as the **_hat-check problem_**. Each of $n$ customers gives a hat to a hat-check person at a restaurant. The hat-check person gives the hats back to the customers in a random order. What is the expected number of customers who get back their hat?

> Let $A[1..n]$ be an array of $n$ distinct numbers. If $i < j$ and $A[i] > A[j]$, then the pair $(i, j)$ is called an **_inversion_** of $A$. (See Problem 2-4 for more on inversions.) Suppose that the elements of $A$ form a uniform random permutation of $\langle 1, 2, \ldots, n \rangle$. Use indicator random variables to compute the expected number of inversions.
