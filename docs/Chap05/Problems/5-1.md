> With a $b$-bit counter, we can ordinarily only count up to $2^b - 1$. With R. Morris's **_probabilistic counting_**, we can count up to a much larger value at the expense of some loss of precision.

> We let a counter value of $i$ represent that a count of $n_i$ for $i = 0, 1, \ldots, 2^b - 1$, where the $n_i$ form an increasing sequence of nonnegative values. We assume that the initial value of the counter is $0$, representing a count of $n_0 = 0$. The $\text{INCREMENT}$ operation works on a counter containing the value $i$ in a probabilistic manner. If $i = 2^b - 1$, then the operation reports an overflow error. Otherwise, the $\text{INCREMENT}$ operation increases the counter by $1$ with probability $1 / (n_{i + 1} - n_i)$, and it leaves the counter unchanged with probability $1 - 1 / (n_{i + 1} - n_i)$.

> If we select $n_i = i$ for all $i \ge 0$, then the counter is an ordinary one. More interesting situations arise if we select, say, $n_i = 2^{i - 1}$ for $i > 0$ or $n_i = F_i$ (the $i$th Fibonacci numberâ€”see Section 3.2).

> For this problem, assume that $n_{2^b - 1}$ is large enough that the probability of an overflow error is negligible.

> **a.** Show that the expected value represented by the counter after $n$ $\text{INCREMENT}$ operations have been performed is exactly $n$.
>
> **b.** The analysis of the variance of the count represented by the counter depends on the sequence of the $n_i$. Let us consider a simple case: $n_i = 100i$ for all $i \ge 0$. Estimate the variance in the value represented by the register after $n$ $\text{INCREMENT}$ operations have been performed.
