> Professor Marceau objects to the loop invariant used in the proof of Lemma 5.5. He questions whether it is true prior to the first iteration. He reasons that we could just as easily declare that an empty subarray contains no $0$-permutations. Therefore, the probability that an empty subarray contains a $0$-permutation should be $0$, thus invalidating the loop invariant prior to the first iteration. Rewrite the procedure $\text{RANDOMIZE-IN-PLACE}$ so that its associated loop invariant applies to a nonempty subarray prior to the first iteration, and modify the proof of Lemma 5.5 for your procedure.

> Prove that in the array $P$ in procedure $\text{PERMUTE-BY-SORTING}$, the probability that all elements are unique is at least $1 - 1 / n$.

Let $\Pr\\{j\\}$ be the probability that the element with index $j$ is unique. If there are $n^3$ elements, then the $\Pr\\{j\\} = 1 - \frac{j - 1}{n^3}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Pr\\{1 \cap 2 \cap 3 \cap \ldots\\}
    & =   \Pr\\{1\\} \cdot \Pr\\{2 \mid 1\\} \cdot \Pr\\{3 \mid 1 \cap 2\\} \cdots \\\\
    & =   1 (1 - \frac{1}{n^3})(1 - \frac{2}{n^3})(1 - \frac{3}{n^3}) \cdots \\\\
    & \ge 1 (1 - \frac{n}{n^3}) (1 - \frac{n}{n^3})(1 - \frac{n}{n^3}) \cdots \\\\
    & \ge (1 - \frac{1}{n^2})^n \\\\
    & \ge 1 - \frac{1}{n}, \\\\
\end{aligned}
$$

where the last step holds for $(1 - x)^n \ge 1 - nx$.

## 5.3-6

> Explain how to implement the algorithm $\text{PERMUTE-BY-SORTING}$ to handle the case in which two or more priorities are identical. That is, your algorithm should produce a uniform random permutation, even if two or more priorities are identical.

```cpp
PERMUTE-BY-SORTING(A)
    let P[1..n] be a new array
    for i = 1 to n
        P[i] = i
    for i = 1 to n
        swap P[i] with P[RANDOM(i, n)]
```

## 5.3-7

> Suppose we want to create a **_random sample_** of the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \ldots, n\\}$, that is, an $m$-element subset $S$, where $0 \le m \le n$, such that each $m$-subset is equally likely to be created. One way would be to set $A[i] = i$ for $i = 1, 2, 3, \ldots, n$, call $\text{RANDOMIZE-IN-PLACE}(A)$, and then take just the first $m$ array elements. This method would make $n$ calls to the $\text{RANDOM}$ procedure. If $n$ is much larger than $m$, we can create a random sample with fewer calls to $\text{RANDOM}$. Show that the following recursive procedure returns a random $m$-subset $S$ of $\\{1, 2, 3, \ldots, n\\}$, in which each $m$-subset is equally likely, while making only $m$ calls to $\text{RANDOM}$:

> ```cpp
> RANDOM-SAMPLE(m, n)

>         return Ø
>     else S = RANDOM-SAMPLE(m - 1, n - 1)
>         i = RANDOM(1, n)
>         if i ∈ S
>             S = S ∪ {n}
>         else S = S ∪ {i}
>         return S
